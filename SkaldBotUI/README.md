# SkaldBotUI


HOW TO SET UP

First you may need to have node.js installed on your machine.
Next, I recommend creating a bat file to run the SkaldBotAPI through cmd so you can have the webapi running while testing the UI. This is needed for many UI functions

Secondly, you need to run the SkaldBotUI project in visual studio. If you have NodeJS installed, it should automatically build the project, start the development server, and provide you the link to access the page. 

Once you go to the URL, the site should be loaded and you can start using.
