# SkaldBotUI


HOW TO SET UP

First you may need to have node.js installed on your machine.
Next, I recommend creating a bat file to run the SkaldBotAPI through cmd so you can have the webapi running while testing the UI. This is needed for many UI functions

Then run the following commands through your command window:

npm install -g vue-cli

Point directory to the SkaldbotUI project

npm run dev

If these steps do not work, reach out to me and I will see if I can help.
