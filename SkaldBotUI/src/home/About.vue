                The SkaldBot began as a half drunken joke by the original creator who wanted to immortalize his loss in Elite: Dangerous on the Discord server he and his friends used while playing.&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                He later realized that with the help of some friends, it could become something much, much more annoying. And potentially even useful!&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm">
                This is how we ended up with the fun little SkaldBot you have been enjoying.<br>
                <br>
                This site is intended to be the user interface where non-developers can submit their own things for the bot to say (pending approval of course).&nbsp;
